<h3> <strong> Projects </strong> </h3>
<ul>
  <li> 2020 Bruin Actuarial Society Case Competition </li>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
      <li> Our team of four was given one week to manage the liability and insurance policies for a fictitious insurance company. </li>
      <li> We then presented our findings from various models to a panel of officers. </li>
      <li> While the competition was challenging, we gained valuable experience in data cleaning, model testing, financial management and product communication. I plan on competing again this January! <br> <a href="2020bascomp.pdf">2021 presentation</a> <br> <a href="2022_Team_16_Slides.pdf">2022 presentation</a> </li>
